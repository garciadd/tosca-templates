# Recipe for impatient users

Below the 4 steps for a user to get started with a basic sample

1. Register to the IAM-DODAS service by accessing [https://dodas-iam.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/](https://dodas-iam.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/) and wait for approval. Once approved:
2. get your first DODAS token by using the recipe here : https://indigo-iam.github.io/docs/v/current/user-guide/getting-a-token.html
   * For very impatient user just download this [https://gist.github.com/andreaceccanti/5b69323b89ce08321e7b5236de503600](https://gist.github.com/andreaceccanti/5b69323b89ce08321e7b5236de503600) run the script and follow the instructions.
3. Checkout the test template here Simple VM with ssh da committare
4. Submit the TOSCA either to PaaS or to IM.

* Submit Te TOSCA template to PaaS

* TOSCA template for a batch system

Once again, repeating 1 to 3 and checking out this: TOSCA per Spark, you can ask DODAS to deploy a Spark Cluster.. Possbily joining a Existing HDFS with your data.

If you like to deploy your HDFS through DODAS here is the recipe:
