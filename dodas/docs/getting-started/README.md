**There use case currently supported, which means use case with a already developed TOSCA \(plus Ansible\) are described below:**

* * **HTCondor bacth system**  
    * **Meant as a complete HTCondor batch system \(Schedd, Central Manager and Startd \)**
    * **Extension of  a existing Pool \( pre configured startd to auto-join a existing HTCondor poo\)l**  
  * **BigData**
    * **Currently this is about a Spark framework possibly coupled with a HDFS \(either pre-existing or generated on demand\) for data I/O**
