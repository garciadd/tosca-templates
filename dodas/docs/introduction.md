# Introduction

The mission of DODAS is to act as cloud enabler for scientists seeking to easily exploit distributed and heterogeneous clouds to process, manipulate or generate data. Aiming to reduce the learning curve as well as the operational cost of managing community specific services running on distributed cloud, DODAS completely automates the process of provisioning, creating, managing and accessing a pool of heterogeneous computing and storage resources.  
Within the EOSC-hub project DODAS is providing both the **PaaS core services** and a **Enabling Facility** \(Cloud@CNAF and Cloud@ReCaS-Bari\). Although DODAS PaaS core layer can be used to exploit any cloud, we foreseen that a user might benefit of a Enabling Facility where to test a customisation and/or simply try out how DODAS works.  
DODAS has been integrated by the Submission Infrastructure of [Compact Muon Solenoid](https://home.cern/about/experiments/cms) \(CMS\), one of the two bigger and general purposes experiments at LHC of CERN, as well as by the [Alpha Magnetic Specrometer](http://www.ams02.org/) \(AMS-02\) computing environment.The objective of this user guide is to provides not only 

The guide provides not only an overview of the architecture and basic concepts and ideas behind DODAS, but also a comprehensive documentation for users willing to Instantiate a HTCondor batch system, a Big Data Cluster setup \(Spark plus HDFS\) either exploiting the DODAS provided Enabling Facility or a user provided public Cloud as well as a private Cloud \(Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Open Telekom Cloud etc etc\).  
Moreover this guide provide the reader guidelines on how to customise and extend the DODAS workflow.  However, if you feel you are a impatient user, [**this is the section**](https://dodas.gitbook.io/dynamic-on-demand-analysis-service/~/edit/drafts/-LEDKwAyU8rRIV1lDMsb/untitled) you are looking for.
